- 👋 Hi, I’m @amashigeo. \\
I do not know much about programming and only use IDL and Matlab for processing remote sensing/astronomical data currently.\\
Most of my codes can only apply on my data and are useless for others.
- 👀 I’m interested in novel writing and game producing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: maybe nothing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: nothing now.
- 📫 Contact me at amashigeo@gmail.com./825419319.
